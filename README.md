##What It Is
---
W2W is an application that fetches data from two different APIs (IMDb and Streaming Availability) to display information about movies and TV shows based on the user's input. W2W allows users to search for titles or actors, and display the request with trailers and links to streaming services. To get started, type a title or actor in the search bar above.

This project was a colaboration between Dezarea Bryan and Tri Vu.
